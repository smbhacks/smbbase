The only folder relevant here is based on what you have selected in code/settings.asm
If you don't know which driver to use, here's a quick rundown:

OriginalSMBMusic:
	- Less CPU usage
	- Faithful SFX
	- Completely unmodified SMB1 music engine
	- Very harsh compositional limitations:
		- A part needs to contain all of the music data (SQ2, SQ1, TRI, NOI) within 256 bytes 
		  from the SQ2's starting address
		- Only the overworld has multiple parts (hardcoded)
		- Instruments are hardcoded, SQ1 and SQ2 use the same instrument per song (not part!)
		- Small note range (SQ1's even smaller)
		- etc..

VanillaPlusMusic:
	- Less CPU usage
	- Faithful SFX
	- Slightly modified SMB1 music engine for quality of life changes
	- You can import songs from Famitracker or Famistudio via the txt export (Dn-Famitracker 5+ txt export not supported yet)
	- The same very harsh compositional limits BUT:
		- Easy instrument export from Famitracker/Famistudio
		- Every song can have multiple parts
		- A slightly better pitch table, also modifiable for the importer
		- Cut-off note for Triangle implemented

Famitone5Music and FamistudioMusic:
	- More CPU usage
	- Slightly different SFX (possibly going to be fixed in the future)
	- Famitracker and Famistudio txt import with way less limitations (effects, volume coloumn, wide note range, etc..)
