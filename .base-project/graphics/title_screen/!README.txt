To edit the title screen data, you need to have NEXXT installed

Step 1: 
	Open NEXXT

Step 2: 
	At File->Patterns, open the CHR file (they are in the graphics/chr folder)

Step 3: 
	At File->Canvas, select "Open canvas (map or nametable)", and open titlescreen_nexxt.nam

Step 4 (optional): 
	Now that you've opened up the CHR file and the nametable file, you get the titlescreen,
	however you have some pretty funky palettes. If you want to, you can load in the default
	SMB1 overworld palettes by selecting File->Subpalettes->Open as current set... and open
	overworld.pal

Step 5:
	Edit your title screen.

Step 6:
	At File->Canvas, select "Save as screen (32x30)" and save it to titlescreen_nexxt.nam.
	You may now close NEXXT.

Step 7:
	Run "import.bat" to import your changes to the base. 

Step 8:
	Celebration. Profit. Swag.
